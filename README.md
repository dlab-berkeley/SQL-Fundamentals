This repository contains the materials for D-Labâ€™s SQL Fundamentals workshop series. 

### Prerequisites
No prior experience with SQL or Python is required.

Check D-Lab's [Learning Pathways](https://dlab-berkeley.github.io/dlab-workshops/python_path.html) to figure out which of our workshops to take!


## Workshop Goals

This workshop introduces the fundamentals of SQL, with a focus on using SQLite (the most ubiquitous database on the planet) for data science tasks. We'll explore how SQL can be used to query and manipulate relational databases. This hands-on workshop includes exercises based on real-world datasets.

## Learning Objectives

After completing SQL Fundamentals, you will be able to:
- Navigate and understand the structure of a relational database.
- Become familiar with relational database concepts.
- Have basic understanding of SQL syntax (e.g., `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE` clauses).
- Write SQL queries to select, filter, and sort data.
- Perform complex joins between tables to retrieve related data.
- Use aggregate functions to summarize data.
    
This workshop does **not** cover the following:
- Cloud Databases or Database Servers. This is covered in [Cloud SQL Databases for Social Media Data](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/events/cloud-sql-databases-social-media-data/2024-12-10).

## Workshop Structure

SQL Fundamentals is a 2 hour workshop, and is delivered in a lecture-style coding walkthrough interrupted by challenge problems and a break. Instructors and TAs are dedicated to engaging you in the classroom and answering questions in plain language.

1. **Part 1: SQLite Installation**
2. **Part 2: Simple SQLite Queries**
3. **Part 3: Northwind Database Overview**
4. **Part 4: Northwind SQLite Exercises**

## Installation Instructions

Before attending the workshop, you should install Python and Jupyter to your computer. If you need help, please submit a [consulting request](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting/submit-consulting-request) with D-Lab prior to the start of the workshop.

Then follow the steps in the [installation instructions notebook](SQLite-Setup.ipynb)

## Is Python not working on your laptop?

If you do not have Anaconda installed and the materials loaded on your workshop by the time it starts, we *strongly* recommend using the UC Berkeley Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by clicking this button:

[![Datahub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](http://dlab.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FSQL-Fundamentals&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FSQL-Fundamentals%2F)

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and allows you to run the materials in a Jupyter notebook that is stored on UC Berkeley's servers. No installation is necessary from your end - you only need an internet browser and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go straight to [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on the `SQL-Fundamentals` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in Binder, which is another cloud-based option. Click this button:

Note: Using Binder, you unfortunately cannot save your work.
